# Structure
The structure is set up such that each subdirectory contains all code for a specific page, with the exception of the [utils](/frontend/utils) folder. This directory contains scripts common between pages.

Scripts in subdirectories are named based on what they do. HTML and CSS files are given their generic names.

This structure also extends to child pages (pop-up pages). The directory for the [notes manage](/frontend/batterylist/notesmanage) page is an example of this rule.
