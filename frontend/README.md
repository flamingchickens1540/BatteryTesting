# Frontend
The frontend is home to all the app's webpage files and scripts. The folders and files loosely follow a structure that helps make organization easier. Information about it can be found [here](/structure.md).

All Javascript scripts within the frontend are also written with JavaScript modules. This choice was made to make code easier to understand and better organized.
